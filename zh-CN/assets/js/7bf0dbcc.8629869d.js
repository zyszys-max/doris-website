This is how Apache Doris manages to achieve both high throughput and high concurrency. It allows you to deal with various data analytic workloads on one single platform and experience quick data analytics for various scenarios. Thanks to the great efforts of the Apache Doris community and a group of excellent SelectDB engineers, Apache Doris 2.0 is about to be released soon."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},2974:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/high-concurrency_1-90fb6261659bb3cce5ad8076fa9dc65d.png"},323349:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/high-concurrency_2-24db356001a7e9c6276202b59ce09d03.png"},411724:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/high-concurrency_3-78f37932ab22095589cd35e1829eba6b.png"},461123:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/high-concurrency_4-3a2f6a6b077605a579c5b00560e0cffb.png"},871290:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/high-concurrency_5-91a7b2adc421fb31c47d89f638adecf6.png"},47537:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/high-concurrency_6-6c3bbd4d2c6e6a54db40297c2154a9da.png"}}]);
