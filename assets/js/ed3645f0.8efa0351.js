This is because the "OBSERVER" seen here is recorded in Doris\'s metadata, but whether it is master or not, is recorded in bdbje\'s metadata. Because we recovered from an OBSERVER node, there was inconsistency. Please take the following steps to fix this problem (we will fix it in a later version):\n\n> 1. First, all FE nodes except this "OBSERVER" are DROPed out.\n> 2. A new FOLLOWER FE is added through the `ADD FOLLOWER` command, assuming that it is on hostA.\n> 3. Start a new FE on hostA and join the cluster by `helper`.\n> 4. After successful startup, you should see two FEs through the `show frontends;` statement, one is the previous OBSERVER, the other is the newly added FOLLOWER, and the OBSERVER is the master.\n> 5. After confirming that the new FOLLOWER is working properly, the new FOLLOWER metadata is used to perform a failure recovery operation again.\n> 6. The purpose of the above steps is to manufacture a metadata of FOLLOWER node artificially, and then use this metadata to restart fault recovery. This avoids inconsistencies in recovering metadata from OBSERVER.\n\n>The meaning of `metadata_failure_recovery = true` is to empty the metadata of `bdbje`. In this way, bdbje will not contact other FEs before, but start as a separate FE. This parameter needs to be set to true only when restoring startup. After recovery, it must be set to false. Otherwise, once restarted, the metadata of bdbje will be emptied again, which will make other FEs unable to work properly.\n')),(0,i.yg)("ol",{start:4},(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"After the successful execution of step 3, we delete the previous FEs from the metadata by using the ",(0,i.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"ALTER SYSTEM DROP FOLLOWER/OBSERVER")," command and add them again by adding new FEs.")),(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"If the above operation is normal, it will be restored."))),(0,i.yg)("h3",{id:"fe-type-change"},"FE type change"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"If you need to change the existing FOLLOWER/OBSERVER type FE to OBSERVER/FOLLOWER type, please delete FE in the way described above, and then add the corresponding type FE."),(0,i.yg)("h3",{id:"fe-migration"},"FE Migration"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"If you need to migrate one FE from the current node to another, there are several scenarios."),(0,i.yg)("ol",null,(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"FOLLOWER, or OBSERVER migration for non-MASTER nodes"),(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"After adding a new FOLLOWER / OBSERVER directly, delete the old FOLLOWER / OBSERVER.")),(0,i.yg)("li",{parentName:"ol"},(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"Single-node MASTER migration"),(0,i.yg)("p",{parentName:"li"},"When there is only one FE, refer to the ",(0,i.yg)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Failure Recovery")," section.
